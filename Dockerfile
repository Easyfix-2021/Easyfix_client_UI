# Easyfix_client_UI — multi-stage production image
#
# Stage 1 (deps):    Install ALL deps (incl. devDeps — Tailwind, TS, Next).
# Stage 2 (builder): Run `next build` with NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL baked in.
#                    Produces .next/standalone/ thanks to output: 'standalone'
#                    in next.config.mjs.
# Stage 3 (runner):  Copy ONLY the standalone output + static assets +
#                    public/. No node_modules (standalone bundles its own
#                    minimal copy), no source, no devDeps.
#
# Image size: ~180 MB (vs ~900 MB if we shipped the full node_modules).
#
# CRITICAL: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is read AT BUILD TIME and baked into the
# static JS chunks. Every browser that loads the bundle hits whatever URL
# was set when `next build` ran. The GitHub workflow passes this as a
# `--build-arg` so each environment (QA / Production) gets the right URL.
# The build-arg is reflected in the image tag too, so we never accidentally
# deploy a QA-baked image to production.

# Sanity-check the bake BEFORE building so we don't waste 30s+ on a

#   2. Not localhost / not a placeholder — we'd never ship a bundle
#      that talks to localhost in prod.
#   3. Ends with `/api` — `src/lib/api.ts` builds requests as
#      `/api/client${path}` and the Next rewrite proxies `/api/*` to
#      `${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/*`, so the base MUST include `/api`.
